        ### Set the route

        First you need to tell express that there is a new route. Open the `routes.js` file.

        Set the route you want as the first argument of the `app.get()` function. For the homepage, we have `'/'`.

        Set the view you want as the first argument of the `res.render()` function. By default, Bibliosoph comes with 4 views:

        - **one_col:** All the content is displayed into one column 
        - **one_col_nav:** same as `one_col`, plus an automatically generated navigation.
        - **two_col:** The content is divided into two columns like the [Backbone annoted source](http://backbonejs.org/docs/backbone.html).
        - **two_col_nav:** same as `two_col`, plus an automatically generated navigation.

        folderToHTML is a library that let you pre-render an entire folder into an html partial that is then passed to the view. It has a simple API:

        - **render**: Takes the directory path as an argument. It like a init function, it must be called first.
        - **getMenuHTML**: returns the html for the navigation. It is useful only if you use a view that render the navigation.
        - **getSectionsHTML**: returns the html for files.

        Finally, you can pass an `active` variable to the view. It is only used to know which menu item should be displayed as active. Then, it must match the class you have defined in the `config.json` for the menu item.

          res.render('two_col_nav', {
            title: "Documentation template",
            active: 'home',
            menu: folderToHTML.getMenuHTML(),
            html: folderToHTML.getSectionsHTML()
          })
        });
        ```
