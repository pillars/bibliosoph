        ## Brand it

        Depending on your project's documentation, you may need different levels of organization. Maybe you need a simple on-page documentation or a more structured documentation with pages.

        ### Edit the layout

        Just open the `views/layout.jade` and edit whatever you want in it to fit your needs. Change the title, change the .logo text, set the menu items...
